**Optimizing Tropical Fruit Supply Chain Dynamics through Computer Vision-Driven Pricing Strategies**   
Remote participation in a project at the National University of Singapore Institute of Operations Research, which aims to optimize pricing strategies within the tropical fruit supply chain through the utilization of computer vision technology to expand profit margins.   
My primary responsibility involves the development and implementation of an advanced deep learning-based image analysis technique, designed to accurately predict the shelf life of tropical fruits.

**Noisy-Label Driven Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation**      
In image classification, noisy labels are a recognized issue and subject of extensive research. Labeling in image segmentation is more error-prone and time-intensive. Many studies advocate for weakly-supervised methods, indicating segmentation can be efficiently performed using basic annotations like bounding boxes or scribbles. Such labels are inherently noisy; therefore, it is natural for us to apply the classical concept of noisy labels to the study of image segmentation tasks. We aim to introduce new insights and outcomes to the field by leveraging this approach.
