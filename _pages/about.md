**Diffusion Models As Dataset Distillation Priors**   
Dataset distillation seeks to create compact yet informative datasets, but balancing diversity, generalization, and representativeness remains challenging. We propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which leverages the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models by quantifying synthetic‚Äìreal data similarity in feature space with a Mercer kernel and guiding the reverse diffusion process without retraining.

**When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models**   
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong results but suffer from text dominance, where textual inputs outweigh other modalities. We present the first systematic study of this issue across images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs, introducing two metrics‚Äîthe Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and Attention Efficiency Index (AEI)‚Äîto quantify the imbalance. Our analysis reveals its pervasive nature and key causes, and we propose a simple token compression method that rebalances attention, reducing LLaVA-7B‚Äôs MDI from 10.23 to 0.86. This work offers insights and methods for building more balanced multimodal models.

**Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation**   
Dataset condensation faces inherent trade-offs between performance and fidelity. Current methods struggle with inefficiency (image-level selection) or semantic distortion (pixel-level optimization). We identify color‚Äôs dual role as an information carrier and semantic unit as critical. To address this, we propose DC3, which enhances color diversity via latent diffusion models after calibrated image selection. Experiments show DC3 outperforms SOTA methods across benchmarks. Notably, DC3 enables fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets without degradation (validated by FID scores), marking the first exploration of this capability.

**FMCHS: Advancing Traditional Chinese Medicine Herb Recommendation with Fusion of Multiscale Correlations of Herbs and Symptoms**   
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy in disease treatment and healthcare through personalized herb prescriptions. However, current herb recommendation models inadequately capture the multiscale relations between herbs and clinical symptoms, particularly neglecting latent correlations at the chemicalmolecular scale. To address these limitations, we propose the Fusion of Multiscale Correlations of Herbs and Symptoms (FMCHS), an innovative framework that synergistically integrates molecular-scale chemical characteristics of herbs with clinical symptoms. The framework employs multi-relational graph transformer layers to generate enriched embeddings that preserve both structural and semantic features within herbs and symptoms. Through systematic incorporation of herb chemical profiles into node embeddings and implementation of attention-based feature fusion, FMCHS effectively utilizes multiscale correlations.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
**Multimodal Classification of Temporally Relevant Images Using Large Pretrained Models**   
Temporally relevant images are visual representations that capture and convey information directly tied to specific points or periods in time. These images may exhibit gradual transformations in appearance, texture, or other visual cues that are challenging for traditional classification algorithms to recognize. To more accurately capture the features of temporally relevant images, we introduce spectral data corresponding to these images and propose a multimodal image classification method. The proposed approach leverages the expert knowledge of the large language model
(i.e. Claude-3.5, GPT-4o) to guide a grounded vision language model and a segment anything model for zero-shot object detection and image segmentation.

**Noisy-Label Driven Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation**      
In image classification, noisy labels are a recognized issue and subject of extensive research. Labeling in image segmentation is more error-prone and time-intensive. Many studies advocate for weakly-supervised methods, indicating segmentation can be efficiently performed using basic annotations like bounding boxes or scribbles. Such labels are inherently noisy; therefore, it is natural for us to apply the classical concept of noisy labels to the study of image segmentation tasks. We aim to introduce new insights and outcomes to the field by leveraging this approach.
