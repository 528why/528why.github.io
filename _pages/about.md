<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am **Huyu Wu (伍胡宇)**, a first-year Master's student at the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT)](http://www.ict.cas.cn/). Currently, I am exploring the frontiers of **Agentic Search** as a **Search Algorithm Intern** at **Xiaohongshu (RED)**.

My previous research background covers **Dataset Distillation** and **Time Series Analysis**, where I explored methods for efficient data representation and robust forecasting. I am always open to discussions and potential collaborations!

**Diffusion Models As Dataset Distillation Priors**   
Dataset distillation seeks to create compact yet informative datasets, but balancing diversity, generalization, and representativeness remains challenging. We propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which leverages the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models by quantifying synthetic–real data similarity in feature space with a Mercer kernel and guiding the reverse diffusion process without retraining.

**When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models**   
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong results but suffer from text dominance, where textual inputs outweigh other modalities. We present the first systematic study of this issue across images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs, introducing two metrics—the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and Attention Efficiency Index (AEI)—to quantify the imbalance. Our analysis reveals its pervasive nature and key causes, and we propose a simple token compression method that rebalances attention, reducing LLaVA-7B’s MDI from 10.23 to 0.86. This work offers insights and methods for building more balanced multimodal models.
